<h3>Question: What areas of Massachusetts are located more than two miles away from a fire station?</h3>
<h3>Geoprocessing tools used: Buffer, dissolve, difference</h3>
<h3>Method: I began by placing a two-mile buffer around each point in the dataset of points that represent fire stations in the state of Massachusetts. I then dissolved this buffer to create a single layer that represents areas in the state that fall within two miles in any direction of a fire station. Finally, to define the areas that fall further than two miles of a fire station, I used the difference tool to subtract the dissolved buffer from the polygon of Massachusetts. </h3>
<h3>Data sources: All data came from the <a href="https://www.mass.gov/info-details/massgis-data-layers"> Massachusetts government website. </a> Layers used were "fire stations" and "counties".
